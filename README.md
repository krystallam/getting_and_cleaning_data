# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is an intruction on how to execute the program:

**1. Download the source data from the below website. It is the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.**

* Data:https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

* Desription: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

**2. Unzip the zipped dataset to your working directory**

**3. Run the script run_analysis.R in you R, it should perform the following:**

  * Read in Files
  * Label all columns
  * Combine the datasets by columns
  * Combine the datasets by rows
  * Find the varaible names with mean or stdPart2
  * Etracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  * creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

**4. A cleaned tidy dataset can be found under your working directory called tidydata.txt**

**5. Code book is available for more details on the data**
